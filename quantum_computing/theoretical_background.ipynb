    "## Useful Resources\n",

    "- Lectures by Leonard Susskind: https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=A27CEA1B8B27EB67\n",
    "- Series by Jonathan Hui: https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/qc-quantum-computing-series-10ddd7977abd\n",

    "## Complex Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "A complex number is any number that can be written as $a + bi$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit and $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. $a$ is called the real part of the number, and $b$ is called the imaginary part of the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that: \n",
    "\n",
    "$i = \\sqrt{-1}$ and $i^{2} = -1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Algebraic equations work the same as if $i$ was a normal variable.  \n",
    "Therefore e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "$(5 + 3i) + (-3 -i) = 2 + 2i$\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on. Mixed terms can be simplified so that we end up with $i$ again:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(-a)^{0.5} = (-1 * a)^{0.5} = (-1)^{0.5} * a^{0.5} = i * a^{0.5}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bra-ket Notation (Dirac)\n",
    "\n",
    "The bra represents row vectors and is denoted $\\langle\\psi|$; the ket represents column vectors and is denoted $|\\psi \\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\langle0| := \\left[ \\begin{array}{ c } 1 & 0 \\end{array} \\right] \\space\\space\\space$\n",
    "$\\langle0| := \\left[ \\begin{array}{ c c } 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array} \\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\langle1| := \\left[ \\begin{array}{ c } 0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right] \\space\\space\\space$\n",
    "$\\langle1| := \\left[ \\begin{array}{ c c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Qubits often are represented with a linear combination of $|0 \\rangle$ and $|1 \\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\psi \\rangle = \\alpha |0 \\rangle + \\beta |1 \\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "## One qubit system\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\alpha|^2$ and $|\\beta|^2$ represent the probability of what a qubit will be measured as (since it flips to 1 or 0 once measured). Therefore we can represent a single qubit like a two dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\left[ \\begin{array}{ c c } \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{array} \\right]$ such that $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = \\alpha \\bar{\\alpha} + \\beta \\bar{\\beta} = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi qubit system\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined state of multiple qubits is the tensor product (the symbol is $\\otimes$) of all the qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "|0 \\rangle \\otimes |1 \\rangle =\n",
    "\\left[ \\begin{array}{ c c } 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array} \\right] \\otimes \\left[ \\begin{array}{ c c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right]=\n",
    "\\left[ \\begin{array}{ c c } 1 \\cdot \\left[ \\begin{array}{ c c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right] \\\\ 0 \\cdot \\left[ \\begin{array}{ c c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{array} \\right]=\n",
    "\\left[ \\begin{array}{ c c c c } 1 \\cdot 0 \\\\ 1 \\cdot 1 \\\\ 0 \\cdot 0 \\\\ 0 \\cdot 1 \\end{array} \\right]=\n",
    "\\left[ \\begin{array}{ c c c c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{array} \\right]\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "And in braket notation we have: $|0 \\rangle \\otimes |1 \\rangle = |0 \\rangle |1 \\rangle = |01 \\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro to calculate with gates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ The identity matrix $I_n$ is applied (when a gate is applied to other qubits) for each qubit without a gate beeing applied in a calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ Keep this relation in mind: $(\\nu_1 \\otimes \\omega_1)(\\nu_2 \\otimes \\omega_2) := (\\nu_1\\nu_2) \\otimes (\\omega_1\\omega_2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example (single qubit gate)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had an initial state of $|0000 \\rangle$ and were to apply a $\\sigma_x$ gate to the first qubit:\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial state can also be written as $(|0 \\rangle \\otimes |0 \\rangle \\otimes |0 \\rangle \\otimes |0 \\rangle)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation for applying $\\sigma_x$ would therefore look like this (keeping in mind that the identity matrix is applied for every qubit without a gate applied):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "(\\sigma_x \\otimes I \\otimes I \\otimes I) \\cdot (|0 \\rangle \\otimes |0 \\rangle \\otimes |0 \\rangle \\otimes |0 \\rangle)=\n",
    "(\\sigma_x |0\\rangle) \\otimes (I |0\\rangle) \\otimes (I |0\\rangle) \\otimes (I |0\\rangle)\n",
